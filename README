**umlaut_kb** is a Linux driver for the 4-keys keyboard with symbols:
ä, ö, ü, ß.

The keyboard itself is based on the TI MSP430F5529 LaunchPad.
I don't publish it's firmware sources here.

I created **umlaut_kb** to extend my laptop's keyboard functionality to achieve the complete German alphabet.

The device requires English International keyboard layout.
